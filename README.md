# Rewritten
A rewrite of the entire Bloons TD 5 game using the Godot game engine

# Goal
The main priority on this repository is to create a mostly faithful re-creation of Bloons TD 5

# FAQ
Below are some questions I think most people would have about this

## How will it work for a user?
In the ideal situation, the resulting exe from Godot will serve as a drop-in alternative to `BTD5-Win.exe` or `BTD5-Kong.exe`.

## Is there mod support?
This repository will not have any more modding support than the base game. Once this project is in a complete enough state, a fork of this repository will be made for modding purposes.

## Will this have bug fixes or performance improvements?
At the moment, most likely not. I don't think it's feasible to make a faithful re-creation of the game and include fixing bugs or issues with the base game without a team backing this project.
